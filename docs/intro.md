# Introduction

### What is Fiji?

Fiji Is Just ImageJ—a “batteries-included” distribution of ImageJ and ImageJ2 which includes many useful plugins contributed by the community.

## What does Fiji provide?

Fiji’s extensibility is the root of its effectiveness: many advanced 
image-processing methods are not provided by the core application, but rather are 
plugins written by specialists in specific fields.
