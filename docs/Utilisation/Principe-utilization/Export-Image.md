## Drag & Drop

You can drag files from your favorite file manager and drop them on 
the main window; ImageJ will load the corresponding files.

Drag ‘n Drop will also work for images displayed in your web browser
, unless they are links to other web pages. You can try with images 
from this page.

## Image windows

Whenever you open an image, be it via 
**File** › **Open**, Drag ‘n Drop or 
**File** › **Open Samples**, ImageJ will open an image window.
<img alt="Windows (64-bit)" src=" https://imagej.net/media/learn/clown-snapshot.jpg" />
  <br/>
The window has the file name as title, and it display 
some useful information above the image: the real 
resolution (in this case in square centimeters), the 
pixel resolution, the image type and the memory required
 by the image.

If your image does not have meta-data about the real 
resolution, you can set the resolution explicitely with
 **Image** › **Properties…** or by following 
 the  <a href="https://imagej.net/imaging/spatial-calibration" target="_blank">tutorial
  on 
 spatial calibration.</a>

 ## Image Types
 You can change the image type:
 <img alt="Windows (64-bit)" src=" https://imagej.net/media/image-types.png" />
 Choose between

 - 8-bit (intensity range 0..255)
 - 16-bit (intensity range 0..65535)
 - 32-bit (floating point numbers)
 - 8-bit color (up to 256 colors encoded via a color lookup table)
- RGB color (3 colors encoded as 8-bit values)

There are two more options: RGB stack and HSV stack, which can turn a 2-dimensional color image into a stack consisting of 3 color channels (red, green & blue or hue, saturation & value, respectively).
